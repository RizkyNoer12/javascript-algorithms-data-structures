# :star2: Javascript Alghorithms and Data Structures :star2:

## Algorithm :
- [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) = a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) = a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) = a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

- Fibonacci = the fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1. These are the first and second terms, respectively. After this, every element is the sum of the preceding elements. Given a number (position), calculate the fibonacci number at that position.

- [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) = a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

- Harmless Ransom Note = you have been given two strings. you have to find out whether you can make up the first string with the words present in the second string.

- Is Palindrome = a number or string that is same after reverse.

- Max Stock Profit = the cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the max profit that you can make by buying and selling in those days.

- Mean Median Mode = calculate the mean, median and mode of those numbers and return the result as an object.

- Memoized Fibonacci = the fibonacci algorithm that will run at an exponential runtime, the technique called memoization.

- Merge Sort = Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.

- Reverse Array in Place = manipulate array directly and return the result as its reverse.

- Reverse Words = reverse the string without using array.prototype.reverse().

- Sieve Of Eratosthenes = given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number.

- Two Sum = calculate the pairs of numbers from the set that add up to the number.

## Data Structures
- [Big O Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) = a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity or in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm..

- [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) = a node-based binary tree data structure that has properties.

- [Constructor Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) = a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.

- [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) = a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

- [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) = a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.

- [Prototype Object Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype) = a property of the object constructor. And it is also the end of a prototype chain.

- Recursion = the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
